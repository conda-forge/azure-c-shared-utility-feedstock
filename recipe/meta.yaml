# The Git tags originally used the format YYYY-MM-DD, which we adopted for this
# recipe. More recent tags are no longer consistent (eg LTS_07_2022_Ref02) and
# can't be used as valid version strings in a conda recipe. For consistency and
# to ensure that the latest version is always installed, we created the version
# string as the date of the commit that the tag points to. This obviously isn't
# ideal, but fortunately this repository doesn't have a fast release cycle
